# Detection-of-face-shape
Determining the Face shape of a Person using OpenCV &amp; Deep Learning: A DL-based project made using OpenCV &amp; using python libraries such as NumPy(for mathematical calculations), Dlib(for detection of facial landmarks ex: nose, jawline, eyes), and sklearn.cluster(for clustering) and many more involving the extensive use of applications of deep learning to determine the Face-shape of an individual by taking input through a webcam as well as images in a suitable format. It determines the six face shapes: oval, rectangular, oblong, square, round, diamond, and triangle. It assigns the value to the input based on the composition of the face attributes. Face shape helps us in deciding the hairstyle scientifically.
